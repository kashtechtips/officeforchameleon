This repository is for Windows Chameleon.
It installs Office 2010 so it still has the style of Windows 7.

---

Chameleon is based on Windows 10 LTSC 2021.
Please note: Build 0.3 and later have updates disabled by default to prevent bugs with theming.

Since Chameleon uses Windows 10, all hardware which supports 10 should also support Chameleon. This makes driver installation a breeze.

No unnecessary bloatware is preinstalled with Chameleon, meaning the requirements are lightweight. At only 14GB, Chameleon can fit on almost every computer.

Chameleon comes with your favourite accessories from Windows 7 - the classic task manager, sticky notes, games - don't forget the gadgets!
